Here, x is defined as a self-referential lazy list whose head is 1
and whose tail is a delayed evaluation of x itself.

When we execute first(k, x):
1. If k is 0, then the function returns an empty list '() irrespective of what x is.
2. If k is greater than 0, then the function uses (car x) and (force (cdr x)) to construct the list.
This forces the evaluation of x one element at a time.


Hence the expression is well-defined under the condition that the first and k are well-defined
and k is a non-negative integer.

The data structure for x will look as following:
1. A lazy list with a head that contains the integer 1.
2. A tail is a promise to evaluate the rest of the list.
3. The list will also have the same structure as x.
