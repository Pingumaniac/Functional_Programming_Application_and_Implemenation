# Notes

"We might hope that advances in computer architecture, espeically memory architecture, which we have principally discussed in this section, will achieve even greater improvements, but it is not within the scope of this book to go into that. Is it too much to hope that eventually we will be able to design machines to fit the languages which we find it natural to use, or must we always have languages which reflect directly the structure of the machines on which they are executed? (279)"
