# Notes

* imperative => "a program or programming language which computes by effect rather than value (126)"
* variable, constant, arithmeitc expressions, logical expressions, assignment statment -> examples of well-formed expressions
* mathematical semantics (or denotational semantics) = "the method of associating a function with every well-formed construct in a programming language (126)"
* "A functional program which consists of a set of function defintions and which is such that all calls of these defined functions are outermost is said to be in iterative form (150)"
* "not all functional programs are in iterative form (150)"
* net-effect property = "The sequence of statements derived from a well-formed expression will, if executed, leave a single value on top of the stack and otherwise leave unchanged that part of the stack in use before those statements were executed. The single value thus pushed onto the stack will be the value computed for the well-formed expression. (151)"
