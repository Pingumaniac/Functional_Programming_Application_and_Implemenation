# Notes

"A function should be tested only when all the functions which it calls have been tested and, where possible, these subfunctions should have been made to handle the arugments which the calling function will give them. Recursion uddies this nice situation a little but, with a little thought, data can be chosen to progressively exercise the parts of a recursive function, causing it to recur 0,1,. . . more times.
